5/19/2021:  Prep for discussion with daniel and shannon

motivation:  fourier: only a few papers; only MAFFT is application? why? wrong question;

ground work:   deBruijn hash give structure of graph for a given k  cannot reconstruct path through repeats > k
       k = length of genome: one node;

       as k varies (monotonically decreasing: count from nodes split and grow  or edge in k becomes node in k+1


       histo is a projection that contains a lot of info:   

       could use this plus other info:  e.g.  bounded range of counts with complete histo...

examples:
	1.  human mouse:  repeats
	2.  metagenomics sample

	3.  struct variants:  segmental duplications:  human/ape  human polymorphic variation (Eichler)
	4.  op map Cancer genomes (full hash, not hist?)

	5.  sample mixup
